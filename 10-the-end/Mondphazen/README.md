## ðŸ’¡ Motivation

I built Mondphazen to combine my love for luxury watches with web development. This project allowed me to practice:

- Designing in Figma
- Structuring a React app with multiple pages
- Fetching and displaying data from a custom API
- Deploying a live site on Netlify

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps

- Implement full **Cart functionality** with Context API
